# Placebo

The multinational band was formed by singer/guitarist Brian Molko and bassist Stefan Olsdal. Both members had previously attended the same school in Luxembourg, but they didn't cross paths properly until they met by accident at South Kensington train station in 1994. During their 'accidental' meet, Molko invited Olsdal to one of his gigs, where Olsdal was impressed by Molko's unique vocals. Very influenced by the likes of Sonic Youth, the Pixies, the Smashing Pumpkins, and the aforementioned Nirvana.

While briefly known as **Ashtray Heart**, the band soon settled on the name Placebo, after the drug that has no active ingredient but works because the patient believes it does.

## Debut album

Placebo's self-titled debut album was released on 17 June 1996. The album was produced by Brad Wood and was influenced, according to Molko, by Sonic Youth and Depeche Mode. The release peaked at No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart at the height of the Britpop era; *The New York Times* compared them to bands of the "first wave of post-punk rock, particularly New Order, the Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, early U2 and Talking Heads".
