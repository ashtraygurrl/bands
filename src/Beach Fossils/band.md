# Beach Fossils

They are an American indie rock band from Brooklyn, New York, formed in 2009. The group currently includes Dustin Payseur, Jack Doyle Smith and Tommy Davidson. They are known for their **lo-fi, atmospheric sound** and Payseur's vocal style.

Formed in 2009, the act was originally a means to expand the solo project of Dustin Payseur, whose full name is James Dustin Payseur. That same year, bassist John Peña and guitarist Christopher Burke were recruited, followed by Zachary Cole Smith on drums. Their debut single, Daydream/Desert Sand was released in February 2010 on Captured Tracks. In May 2010, their self-titled debut album was released, and met with favorable reviews.

The band’s self-titled 2010 debut established a sound that was both minimal and enveloping. With Somersault, the group’s first release since 2013’s Clash the Truth, Beach Fossils have channeled years of experimentation into expansion and reinvention. Augmented with more complex instrumentation, including string arrangements, piano, harpsichord, flute, and sax, the new songs offer **multi-layered pop guided by sharp, poignant, and honest lyrics**.

## Debut album 
Dustin Payseur's Captured Tracks band claims influence from improvisational jazz, classical music, and Stereolab, and his songwriting owes more to loop-based composition than garage-bound woodshedding. From the functionality of the song titles on down, Beach Fossils has purpose and economy. It's built on cleanly picked single notes stacked over complementary bass patterns and unobtrusive drums.
