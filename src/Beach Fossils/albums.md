*I started as soon as I finished recording What a Pleasure up until October. The process was definitely longer this time than with anything else I had done. I just felt like I was more in my own head for most of it, just working out where I was going with things. I think I wrote about 70-something songs for it, and some of them didn’t feel right. It’s not that I didn’t like them, but they didn’t feel like part of this album. The songs that took the least amount of time to write were the ones that I felt needed to go on this album. There were ones that took less thought.*

## Somersalut (2017)
Released on June 2, 2017. Orchestral pop gem “Saint Ivy” shines with plucked strings, buoyant basslines and a propulsive, wayward, guitar. “Tangerine," a driving, tightly wound melody, rushes forward and briefly leaves the ground due to the gossamer guest vocals of Slowdive’s Rachel Goswell. The effervescent “Rise," which hinges on the spoken word of Gavin Mays (Cities Aviv) discussing a failed relationship, hangs, like many recent breakups, in a sense of suspension. The cloudy, wistful “Social Jetlag,” bustling with samples of crowded streets, features the type of candid, off-the-cuff lyrics that make the entire effort immediately illuminating.

Somersault evokes the laid-back mood of a warm, breezy city night, the air crackling with humidity and excitement. These songs pulse and pull, capturing a blend of promise and heartache. It’s beautiful and layered, a refined, sweeping creation that threads together numerous styles, textures, and themes into a **refreshing**, singular vision.
