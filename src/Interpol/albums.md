# Albums 

## Turn On The Bright Lights (2002)
Is the debut studio album by Interpol, released in August 2002. The album was recorded in November 2001 at Tarquin Studios in Connecticut.

Interpol’s debut album gained so much critical success that not only was it hailed as one of best debuts of 2002, but is considered by some to be one of the **best records of the decade.**

## Antics (2004)
Is the second studio album by American **post-punk revival** band, released in September 2004. The album went on to sell 488,000 copies in the U.S. and over 100,000 in the UK.

## Our Love To Admire (2007)
It was released on July 10th, 2007. It was the first album in which the band used keyboards from the start, which they said was like “having a fifth member”. It was the only record they released through a major label, Capitol Records.

*The cover photograph [of lions attacking an antelope] was taken at a store in Utah, and most of the other photos came from the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles. There’s a great juxtaposition between nature and our work. Our music is very meticulously composed, and there’s something about the chaos of nature that felt provocative and playful. I’m really into design, and everybody was feeling it, which is good. Our band is a democracy, so sometimes it’s a nuisance, like, ‘God, I wish I could be the dictator of something!*

## Interpol (2010)
It is a self-produced album which was released on September 7th, 2010 on Matador Records. The song “Lights” was released as a free download through Interpol’s website in May, 2010.

## El Pintor (2014)
It was released on September 9, 2014 in North America on Matador Records. The album title, which means “the painter” in Spanish, is **an anagram of Interpol**.

It is the band’s first album without bassist Carlos Dengler, who departed the band after the self-titled release in 2010. The role of bass was taken over by frontman Paul Banks, and the album features guest appearances by Brandon Curtis of The Secret Machines, Jellyfish’s Roger Joseph Manning, Jr. and Rob Moose of Bon Iver.

## Marauder (2018)
During a press conference which took place in Mexico City, Paul Banks said the name “Marauder” comes from a **character which appears in a number of the songs**. One song Paul said this character appears in is “*Stay in Touch*”. Marauder sees lyricist Paul Banks being more autobiographical than he was abstract on past releases such as Turn On the Bright Lights and Antics.
